# MIDI SYSEX Display Protocol Proposal

A proposal specification for controlling vector-based display devices through MIDI System Exclusive (SYSEX) messages.

## Overview

This repository contains a proposal MIDI SYSEX protocol specification for controlling display devices that can render vector graphics, text, and interactive controls. The protocol enables real-time visual updates through standard MIDI communication.

## What's Included

- **Drawing primitives**: Lines, rectangles, circles, text, and bitmap icons
- **Interactive controls**: Faders, knobs, buttons, and encoders with MIDI feedback
- **Advanced features**: Message chunking, command batching, and 12-bit coordinate addressing
- **Complete specification**: Detailed command formats, examples, and implementation notes

## Applications

This protocol is ideal for music production interfaces, live performance controllers, embedded display devices, and custom MIDI hardware projects.

## Getting Started

1. Read the complete specification: [`sysex-display-protocol-spec.md`](sysex-display-protocol-spec.md)
2. Review the command formats and message examples
3. Implement basic drawing primitives in your target environment
4. Add interactive control support as needed
